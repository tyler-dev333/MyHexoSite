The story of why I chose this name, I got to say... is not very exciting. The short story is I once saw someone with tattoos of three 9's on their hand. They explained why they chose the tattoo and what it meant to them, but I walked away from this encounter thinking "I am pretty sure there is a poem in Old English that talk repeats the number 9 three times." A short time after this interaction, I decided to create a website to show off my work and portfolio, and the idea of "three nines" was still in my mind, so I chose the domain: three9.

What I was thinking of was the [Nine Herb Charm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nine_Herbs_Charm&oldid=1283628973), which in the [translation](https://www.mimisbrunnr.info/nigon-wyrta-galdor) there is multiple mentions of 9's and 3's but never in the way I was thinking the closest I can find is:

> Sing the above galdor over each of the nine plants. Sing the galdor three times...

But you see the repition of 3's a lot in literature and of course 3+3+3=9, so there were multiple reasons I was willing to choose three9.

Anyway, after I already bought the domain I looked up what 999 means in [angel numbers](https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/extrasensory-perceptions/999-angel-number.htm) and when I saw:

> The angel number 999 indicates that a new phase in life is about to begin

I found it funny, not saying I believe in angel numbers, but this was something new to me, and I certainly hope for new experiences, a new phase, to come along with this project.
